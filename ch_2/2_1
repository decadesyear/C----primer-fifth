C++ guarantees short and int is at least 16 bits, long at least 32 bits, long long at least 64 bits.
The signed can represent positive numbers, negative numbers and zero, while unsigned can only represent numbers no less than zero.
The C and C++ standards do not specify the representation of float, double and long double. It is possible that all three implemented as IEEE double-precision. Nevertheless, for most architectures (gcc, MSVC; x86, x64, ARM) float is indeed a IEEE single-precision floating point number (binary32), and double is a IEEE double-precision floating point number (binary64).
